INFO: [ProjectBase 1-489] The host OS only allows 260 characters in a normal path. The project is stored in a path with more than 80 characters. If you experience issues with IP, Block Designs, or files not being found, please consider moving the project to a location with a shorter path. Alternately consider using the OS subst command to map part of the path to a drive letter.

WARNING: [BD 41-927] Following properties on pin /hls_inst/ap_clk have been updated from connected ip, but BD cell '/hls_inst' does not accept parameter changes, so they may not be synchronized with cell properties:
	FREQ_HZ = 200000000.0 
Please resolve any mismatches by directly setting properties on BD cell </hls_inst> to completely resolve these warnings.
